A quick hacked project made to quickly make React Apps accessible as Wordpress Themes without having to rebuild the React Apps. <br/><br/><br/>
Create a folder called reactBuild <br/>
add the build files of a react site into that folder <br/><br/>

Edit the `config.js` file with the appropriate information

start the program with `node .`<br/><br/>

the build would be in a created folder with the name entered in the `config.js` file<br/><br/>

other stuff like updater code, version number, need to be added after
